    bit of the inputs (`inputs&1`), while input `2` refers to the the next bit along
    (`(inputs>>1)&1`).

    Negative inputs represent negated inputs, so an index "-1" represents the negated
    input "~i1", and is the value `!(inputs&1)`, while the index "-7" is the negated
    index "~i7", and the value !((inputs >> 6)&1).

    - SOP_structural_equals(a,b) implies SOP_functional_equals(a,b)
    - SOP_functional_equals(a,b) does not imply SOP_structural_equals(a,b)

    A straightforward way of testing this is:
    - Calculate the largest input index $i_max$ used by either equation.
    - Calculate the width of the truth-table input: $w=i_max+1$
    - For each binary input pattern p in [0..2^w):
       - Check if evaluate(a,p) == evaluate(b,p)
